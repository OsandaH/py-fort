Advantages of Clustering
    Useful when identifying outliers or anomalies in data. 
    Helps by discovering groups of clusters in the data.
    Defines boundaries that distinguish normal data points from outliers.
    Enables the identification of patterns that deviate from the norm.
    Aids in understanding the structure of the data and highlighting unusual data points

Types of Clustering Methods
    Centroid-based method
    Density-Based Clustering
    Distribution Model-Based Clustering
    Hierarchical Clustering
    Fuzzy Clustering

Clustering algorithms like K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be used 
for anomaly detection by identifying data points that do not fit well within any cluster. 

K-means Clustering
  K-Means is a partitioning method that divides a dataset into 'ùëò' clusters
  Objective is to minimize the sum of squared distances within each cluster

  Algo:
    Initialize - choose initial 'k' centroids randomly 
    Assign - assign each data point to the nearest controid 
    Expectation Step 
    Maximization Step 
    Update - Recalculate the centroids based on the assigned data points mean/covariance/mixinf coefficient
    Repeat - Iterate steps 2-3 until convergence (centroids no longer change significantly).

Gaussian Mixture Models
  GMM assigns a probability to each data point for how likely it is to belong to each 
  cluster. Points with low probabilities for all clusters are seen as anomalies because they 
  don‚Äôt fit well with any of the patterns in the model.    

  advantages
    situations. While K-Means assumes all clusters are round and the same size, GMM 
    can handle clusters of different shapes, sizes, and orientations. 

  Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
      The goal of MLE is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function,
      which measures the probability of observing the given data under a specific model.

Expectation Maximization Algorithm
     Likelihood increases with each iteration if a change occurs.

Mutual Information (MI)
    Mutual Information is often used to assess the similarity between the true labels of a dataset and the 
    cluster assignments obtained from a clustering algorithm.

Silhouette Score
 Metric to assess the quality of clustering techniques, including K-Means.
 Measures the degree of separation between clusters.
